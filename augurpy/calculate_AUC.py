    Args:
        input: Anndata or matrix containing gene expression values (genes in rows, cells in columns) and optionally meta
            data about each cell.
        meta: Optional data frame containing meta data about each cell.
        label_col: column of the meta data frame or the anndata or matrix containing the condition labels for each cell
            in the gene-by-cell expression matrix
        cell_type_col: column of the meta data frame or the anndata or matrix containing the cell type labels for each
            cell in the gene-by-cell expression matrix
        n_subsamples: number of random subsamples to draw from complete dataset for each cell type
        subsample_size: number of cells to subsample randomly per type from each experimental condition
        folds: number of folds of cross-validati on to run
        min_cells: minimum number of cells for a particular cell type in each condition in order to retain that type for
            analysis (depricated..)
        var_quantile: quantile of highly variable genes to retain for each cell type using the variable gene filter
        feature_perc: proportion of genes that are randomly selected as features for input to the classifier in each
            subsample using the random gene filter
        n_threads: number of threads to use for parallelization
        show_progress: if TRUE display a progress bar for the analysis with estimated time remaining
        augur_mode: one of default, velocity or permute. Setting augur_mode = "velocity" disables feature selection,
            assuming feature selection has been performed by the RNA velocity procedure to produce the input matrix,
            while setting augur_mode = "permute" will generate a null distribution of AUCs for each cell type by
            permuting the labels
        classifier: classifier to use in calculating the area under the curve either random forest or logistic regression
        rf_params: list of parameters for random forest
        lr_params: list of parameters for logistic regression

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the following keys: Dict[X, y, celltypes, parameters, results, feature_importances, AUC]
        and the Anndata object with additional results layer.
